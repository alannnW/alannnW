# Hey 👋 I'm Alan

I like building things and figuring out how stuff works.

Right now I’m learning, experimenting, and creating projects that help me get better every day.  
Some of it works. Some of it breaks. That’s part of it.

I enjoy:
- Solving problems  
- Cleaning messy data  
- Designing clean systems  
- Trying new ideas

## A little about me

- I have a cat 🐱  
- Naruto is my favorite anime  
- I enjoy the gym, anime, fashion, hiking, and boxing  
- I’m always working on improving myself

More projects coming soon.
